Given an array consisting of positive, distinct integers that represent the time it takes for 
each of n people to cross a bridge. The group has only one torch, and crossing the bridge is 
not possible without it. The bridge can accommodate a maximum of two people at a time, and 
when two people cross together, they must move at the slower personâ€™s pace. 

Devise a dynamic programming algorithm to determine the minimum total time required for all 
individuals to cross from one side of the bridge to the other.
