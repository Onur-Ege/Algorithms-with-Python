Given a row of n coins with the values 𝑣1,…,𝑣𝑛 where n is even, consider a game played by 
two players who alternate turns. In each turn, a player must select either the first or last coin 
from the row, removes it from the row permanently, and collects the value of the coin. The 
game continues until no coins remain, and the player with the highest total value wins.

Design a greedy algorithm that determines the maximum possible amount of money a 
player can guarantee to win if he/she moves first. Provide an example with the comment 
blocks that the greedy algorithm you have developed fails to achieve the optimal result.
