Let x1 < x2 < â€¦ xn be real numbers representing coordinates of n villages located along a 
straight road. A post office needs to be built in one of these villages.  

Design a brute-force algorithm that outputs the post-office location minimizing the average 
distance between the villages and the post office. To verify that your algorithm is indeed a 
brute-force solution, please use the print function.
