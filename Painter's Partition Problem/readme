Given an array representing the lengths of boards and an integer k, where k denotes the 
number of painters available, the objective is to distribute the work among the painters such 
that the maximum time any painter spends is minimized. Each unit length of a board requires 
one unit of time to paint, and each painter can only work on a continuous segment of boards. 
Devise a dynamic programming algorithm to determine the minimum time required to paint 
all the boards. For the input array = [5, 10, 30, 20, 15] and k = 3, your algorithm should output 
35.
